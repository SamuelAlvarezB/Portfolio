# PORTFOLIO PROJECT

Welcome to my portfolio project!

This project has been coded in three different languages:
+ HTML 5
+ CSS 3
+ JavaScript

It contains two HTML pages: **index.html** and **contact.html**.

The first one is the main page and includes some information about me, my most recent projects and my skills. Each project show a description if you hover your mouse on it (coded with JavaScript). The page is responsive designed.
At the top there is a navigation bar with links to the most important sections of the page. If you click in the *Contact* section, contact.html will be loaded.

The other page, **contact.html**, shows a message and my social links, which react to the mouse hover on them. You can go back to the main page, **index.html**, if you click in any other sections of the navigation bar (excluding *Contact* section). This page is also responsive designed.

This project is not finished, as I am still working on it making improvements time to time.

Thanks for your time and, remember, keep coding!
